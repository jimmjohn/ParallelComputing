    "### Communication Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s brief on the different communication patterns seen in parallel computing. Usually, this is about how\n",
    "to map tasks, and memory together. That is mapping threads in CUDA and the memory that they are\n",
    "communicating through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Map\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pattern, map, the program has many data elements: such as the elements of an array, entries in a\n",
    "matrix, or pixels in an image.\n",
    "- Map requires the application of the same function of computation on each piece of data. This means that each thread will read from and write to a specific place in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gather\n",
    "- Suppose you want to each thread to compute and store the average accross a range of data elements.\n",
    "- Suppose that you want to apply a blur to an image, by setting each pixel to the mean of its neighbouring pixels.\n",
    "- This operation is called gather, because each thread gathers input data elements together from different\n",
    "places to compute an output under some operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scatter\n",
    "- Now suppose that you want to do the opposite operation. We can have each thread read an input and take\n",
    "a fraction of its value and add it to the neighbouring points as an output result.\n",
    "- When each thread needs to write its output in a different or multiple places we call this the scatter operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transpose\n",
    "- Transpose is a pattern that can be very useful in array, matrix, image, and data structure manipulation.\n",
    "For example we might have a 2D array, such as an image in row-major order.\n",
